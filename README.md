RN: Added a hide option, so that only data related to the selection is shown.


QlikView have an option to display the filters/listboxes in few styles. Such functionality is missing from Sense (for now).

This extension will give options to display listboxes with more options than default object.

##Available options

Orientation: one row or multiple rows

Object type: Checkboxes, Radio buttons or Buttons

Toggle select: true or false. "false" is like the "only one selected" option in Qlikview

Default selected value: Populated value(s) (comma separated) will be selected after the page refresh. Case sensitive

Active style: style the selected option. Accept valid CSS

InActive style: like the active style but for not active options
